[08:36] <stevenjackson> hi guys

[08:42] *** acardenas left
[08:54] <KillDoor> hello again :-)

[09:20] <stevenjackson> KillDoor: time changes are fixed in air combat.

[09:21] <stevenjackson> KillDoor: what were the conditions you had craft dissapear and reapear? i cant reproduce it

[09:22] <Richlv> stevenjackson, did you see issues reported by me ? :)

[09:22] <KillDoor> I don`t know exactly, and it was with old combats too. It looks like 2 aircrafts become to one point of space, and one of it (always phalanx) moved to random place.

[09:23] <stevenjackson> not yet, havn't check the bug tracker

[09:23] <stevenjackson> what issues were you having Richlv ?

[09:24] <Richlv> stevenjackson, you should have gotten emails about those from the tracker

[09:24] <Richlv> incorrect pathline & craft starting it's trip not from the base, but from some weird location way off the base

[09:24] <Richlv> maybe connected to the issue KillDoor has

[09:25] <KillDoor> I think so

[09:25] <stevenjackson> Richlv: on geoscape or in aircombat?

[09:26] <stevenjackson> hmm i didn't get any bug emails. strange

[09:28] <Richlv> maybe tracker is weird

[09:28] <Richlv> ok, tracker _is_ weird, but i'm not sure how weird it is in this regard ;>

[09:28] <stevenjackson> Richlv: the range issue may have improved since fuel was replaced with the effective range

[09:29] <stevenjackson> the problam was i reduced the craft speed, but because range is based on speed and fuel it reduced range

[09:29] <stevenjackson> i think KrackenO has made a change away from fuel so now you can just specify range

[09:30] <Richlv> yep, he did

[09:30] <stevenjackson> which is better

[09:30] <Richlv> stevenjackson, see https://sourceforge.net/tracker2/?group_id=157793&atid=805242

[09:30] <Richlv> filter with you as an assignee :)

[09:30] <stevenjackson> range shouldn't change if speed does

[09:36] <stevenjackson> Richlv: your "incorrect aircraft pathline" is on the geoscape right? not air combat?

[09:36] <Richlv> mm, geoscape, yes

[09:36] <Richlv> i don't think of those as very different, actually :)

[09:36] <Richlv> isn't air combat mostly zoomed in geoscape ?

[09:36] <Richlv> or is it semi-duplicated and separate ?

[09:37] <stevenjackson> the latter

[09:37] <stevenjackson> its a completely different screen with different code

[09:37] <stevenjackson> some duplicated

[09:37] <stevenjackson> but sperate

[09:37] <stevenjackson> so alot of the geoscape issues no longer apply to aircombat

[09:38] <stevenjackson> for instance there is no 2d/3d mods in aircombat

[09:38] <stevenjackson> modes

[09:38] <stevenjackson> and we can do things in aircombat that we couldn't do in the geoscape.  like having multicraft attack groups, UAV's etc

[09:40] <Richlv> ok. then my issues mostly are in geoscape part, i guess :)

[09:41] <stevenjackson> so far its mostly conceptual, there are a lot of details to work out.  What do you think of the new aircombat mode Richlv? despite being a bit rough

[09:43] <Richlv> stevenjackson, well, i didn't try it out much. it didn't crash for me yet ;)

[09:44] <stevenjackson> Richlv: thats always a good start :)

[09:44] <Richlv> what bugged me a bit was interaction between normal geoscape & combat mode - there should be an easy way to switch between the two

[09:44] <Richlv> currently it's quite hard to do

[09:45] <stevenjackson> i agree.  the only reason its hard it i didnt want to initially impact gameplay too much to start with in case there were too many bugs

[09:45] <Richlv> also, will it be possible for several air combats to happen at the same time ?

[09:45] <Richlv> while that would complicate things, i think it should be somewhat possible

[09:45] <stevenjackson> do you mean in the same place or different places?

[09:47] <Richlv> in the same place it would be the same fight, wouldn't it ?

[09:47] <Richlv> i meant in different places

[09:47] <stevenjackson> if battles are in multiple places you will only see one group at a time, but it could be possible to switch to different battles and you can always exit one and focus on another

[09:48] <KillDoor> may be create something like tabs or tiled screens?

[09:48] <Richlv> right. i think it is important to allow access to bases and such

[09:48] <Richlv> and view stats for the ships involved

[09:49] <Richlv> so you could make decisions on which ship you can move forward and which you should guard

[09:49] <Richlv> which means one should be able to see what soldiers are on the ship, what equipment is there etc

[09:50] <KillDoor> And make events "ship is under attack", "ship has some corruptions" and so on

[09:50] <stevenjackson> did you see the new aircombat screen proposal?

[09:50] <KillDoor> and integrate this events to whole messagesystem.

[09:51] <KillDoor> I`ve seen, but haven`t looked detailed at it

[09:51] <stevenjackson> it has ship status and other such info, as well as allowing control over the crafts to a limited extent

[09:51] <stevenjackson> info on armament and shield

[09:52] <stevenjackson> so it should give more feedback to the player

[09:53] <stevenjackson> in this new change i'm trying to build a framework that will facilitate all these cool features that were not possible with combat zoom

[09:53] <Richlv> great :)

[09:56] <KillDoor> about UAVs, will they start from bases, or there will be a new aircrafts or modules, to carry they?

[09:58] *** ddd joined
[09:59] *** ddd left
[10:04] <Richlv> KillDoor, uavs will be able to board dropships

[10:04] <Richlv> (i think)

[10:04] <KillDoor> And there should be some research topics too :-)

[10:05] <BTAxis> UAVs are just small aircraft.

[10:05] <BTAxis> They start from small hangars.

[10:06] <stevenjackson> they will have their own models and act in a similar way to manned aircraft

[10:08] <stevenjackson> BTAxis: hi, have you tried my new changes yet?

[10:13] <Richlv> ergh, i meant ugvs :)

[10:16] *** geever joined
[10:16] <geever> hi

[10:17] <stevenjackson> geever: hi :)

[10:23] *** Edheldil left
[10:23] <BTAxis> No, I haven't. I did notice you were doing something, but I only caught scraps of the logs, so I don't really know what it is you did.

[10:27] <Richlv> hmm, there are no aircraft models in buy/sell

[10:28] <KillDoor> btw, do you know something about link to diff I sended to channel at morning?

[10:28] <stevenjackson> BTAxis, i've replaced combat zoom with a very rough system, that hopefully will allow some of the things we discussed.

[10:29] <BTAxis> I should probably have a look.

[10:29] <stevenjackson> the background is completely replaced with another image and you can control the zoom yourself

[10:29] <stevenjackson> at the moment the only way to initiate it is to zoom beyond normal while in air combat

[10:29] *** BTAxis sets mode: +v CIA-23

[10:29] <stevenjackson> i'll add other methods once i've worked out some of the kinks

[10:30] <geever> KillDoor, I saw the picture

[10:31] <stevenjackson> but the exit button is broken so just hit escape to exit

[10:31] <geever> The base name can be much longer than the space you left for it

[10:33] <geever> I vote for this: http://ufoai.ninex.info/wiki/index.php/Image:Proposal_Base_Research.jpg

[10:37] <BTAxis> stevenjackson: Looks pretty nice at first glance.

[10:38] <BTAxis> Couldn't really see it in action because my stiletto still had a range of 50cm, heh.

[10:39] *** Tron left
[10:39] <Richlv> bh. range is still so small, even after the changes kracken made ?

[10:40] <stevenjackson> maybe Kracken didn't fix the ranges to be bigger

[10:40] <BTAxis> It was set to 18.

[10:40] <BTAxis> I changed it to 80.

[10:41] <stevenjackson> the problem was because i changed the speed and fuel+speed=range it also changed the range

[10:41] <stevenjackson> the new change away from fuel is mucvh better

[10:41] <BTAxis> I know

[10:44] <stevenjackson> BTAxis: my must frustrating bug so far with the new system is getting interpolation to work for aircraft like it does for missiles.  the aircraft are really jittery.

[10:47] <BTAxis> Man, speed is messed up across the board as well.

[10:47] <BTAxis> The stiletto can't catch ANYTHING.

[10:48] <BTAxis> stevenjackson, do you know how speed and maxspeed are handled right now?

[10:48] <BTAxis> As in, which is used when?

[10:49] <stevenjackson> no, i need to look into it.  most of my speed changes were in relation to air combat, but its broken geoscape speed a bit

[10:49] <stevenjackson> the way i understand it should work is that top speed is for intercepts and the other for cruising

[10:51] <BTAxis> Yeah, I just don't know if that actually does anything ingame.

[10:52] <stevenjackson> let me check

[10:53] <Richlv> <stevenjackson> ... the aircraft are really jittery.

[10:53] <Richlv> oh yeah. good to hear you are working on that ;)

[10:54] <stevenjackson> Richlv: before the baby i spent many hours trying to get it right, just cant understand why it works so well for missiles and not for aircraft

[10:55] <BTAxis> The thing is that the Stiletto can actually catch a Harvester with the values I committed, but only if the Stiletto is using the fast speed and the Harvester is using the cruising speed.

[10:55] <BTAxis> And that's kind of how I want it.

[10:55] <BTAxis> Harvester should be able to outrun the Stiletto if it really wants, but Stiletto should be able to intercept Harvester as well.

[10:56] <stevenjackson> maxspeed isn't used

[10:56] <stevenjackson> just checked

[10:57] <stevenjackson> its stored in the  array but not used anywhere

[10:57] <BTAxis> Okay, that's a conclusion at least.

[10:57] *** de_nis joined
[10:57] <stevenjackson> BTAxis: do you want to raise that as a bug so we dont forget to fix it?

[10:58] <BTAxis> First I should explain what I want to do with it, since this isn't written down anywhere.

[10:59] <BTAxis> The way I think it should work is that all craft use their cruising speeds by default. Then, PHALANX interceptors and attacking UFOs go into combat speed as soon as they come withing x degrees of their target (still outside weapons range though). Also, interceptors and UFOs that try to break off from combat will use their max speed.

[11:00] <BTAxis> I was thinking about adding a mechanic to burn extra fuel during max speed, but let's not do that. It would serve no real purpose.

[11:01] <Richlv> and it would complicate things a lot

[11:02] <Richlv> like, aircraft returns to base because it's low on fuel

[11:02] <BTAxis> Yeah, it would only make things difficult.

[11:02] <Richlv> should it be able to start speedburst ?

[11:02] <Richlv> fuel consumption should be tied to distance travelled

[11:04] <BTAxis> I'm thinking a distance of 10 degrees for attacking max speed.

[11:04] <BTAxis> And a distance of, oh, 30? until dropping out of max speed when fleeing.

[11:05] <BTAxis> Maybe those values are on the high side.

[11:07] <stevenjackson> we also need to get rid of degrees in the configs and make it km's

[11:07] <stevenjackson> and convert it on load

[11:07] <BTAxis> That's something to take up with Kracken.

[11:07] <BTAxis> I don't really mind either way.

[11:08] <BTAxis> Remember though that degrees are used in the code as well (for radar ranges).

[11:08] <BTAxis> I'd prefer uniform units over cosmetics.

[11:09] <stevenjackson> we still keep it in the code as degrees, just in the config as km's

[11:09] <stevenjackson> when the config is loaded it gets converted to degrees

[11:09] <BTAxis> Like I said, I'd rather they be the same, for sanity's sake.

[11:09] <stevenjackson> ok

[11:10] <Richlv> you still would have to display km for user everywhere

[11:10] <BTAxis> But I wouldn't mind if they were converted in both places.

[11:10] <BTAxis> I agree that having km and km/h in the configs would be nice, though.

[11:10] <stevenjackson> nah, its better in the code as degrees

[11:11] <stevenjackson> makes calcs easier

[11:11] <BTAxis> True.

[11:11] <Richlv> i don't care about how it is in code, but user should see km only ;)

[11:11] <BTAxis> Define "user".

[11:12] <BTAxis> People playing the game or people looking at scripts?

[11:12] <stevenjackson> we are the script users

[11:13] <stevenjackson> players wouldn't really understand it enough to make decent values

[11:13] <Richlv> players in this case

[11:13] <Richlv> script writing - as you prefer

[11:14] <Richlv> we should include cli calculator to convert between km and degrees :)

[11:14] <BTAxis> Anyway, should I wrote what i said about the speeds down somewhere, stevenjackson, or is this something you can handle as it is?

[11:15] <stevenjackson> write it down so i dont forget.  a bug would be great.

[11:15] <BTAxis> Okay, I'll do that.

[11:15] <stevenjackson> thanks

[11:16] <stevenjackson> ok, gotta go guys.  see you later

[11:16] *** stevenjackson left
[11:18] <KillDoor> is there any differences in behaviour of crafts in air?

[11:18] <KillDoor> In example, saracien should be not only faster, but also is less manoeuvrable then stiletto. rocket craft can`t rotate immideately, like helicopter-like craft.

[11:18] *** de_nis left
[11:20] <KillDoor> And speed-difference between stiletto and saracien should be larger, in my opinion saracien should be faster then any other atmospheric phalanx crafts, exept last in research tree.

[11:21] <KillDoor> http://ufoai.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ufoai/ufoai/trunk/base/ufos/aircraftmanagement.ufo?annotate=20405&pathrev=20405#l199 -- this is wrong, saracien should be fast, really fast, but with some other disadvantages.

[11:23] <Richlv> i'm not sure how easy it would be to code things like turning radius

[11:23] <BTAxis> It's not wrong.

[11:23] <BTAxis> It was *ridiculously* high before.

[11:23] <BTAxis> Not saying it can't be tweaked some more, but the Saracen shouldn't be THAT much faster.

[11:24] <BTAxis> Or it'll break the game.

[11:24] <KillDoor> yes, before it was very fast, especially in comparison with old values for stiletto.

[11:25] *** Pheredhel left
[11:25] <BTAxis> The Saracen is only the second interceptor. Making it the fastest would be stupid.

[11:27] *** Pheredhel joined
[11:28] <KillDoor> sorry, but do a tortile from rocket is not so smart too. And there should be some other advantages and disadvantages, it can be less defended, or have not much weapons as more last interceptors.

[11:28] <KillDoor> And it should not be fastest interseptor in whole game, just faster then some of next interceptors.

[11:28] <BTAxis> I disagree.

[11:29] <BTAxis> Speed is *the* most important property of any interceptor.

[11:29] <BTAxis> Combat performance matters, sure, but not nearly as much.

[11:29] <BTAxis> You'd have to completely cripple the Saracen to make up for it.

[11:29] <KillDoor> Is there any summary tables about whole set of aircrafts of game?

[11:30] <Richlv> <KillDoor> And it should not be fastest interseptor in whole game, just faster then some of next interceptors.

[11:30] <Richlv> why make second faster than next ones ?

[11:30] <BTAxis> http://ufoai.ninex.info/wiki/index.php/Aircraft <-- As close as it gets.

[11:30] <Richlv> would reduce incentive to get them

[11:30] <BTAxis> Though I don't think we finalized the interceptor list yet.

[11:30] <BTAxis> [12:30:15] <Richlv> would reduce incentive to get them <--

[11:30] <KillDoor> because there is some more parameters to select from

[11:31] <BTAxis> Especially given my statement that speed is what matters most.

[11:31] <BTAxis> I would be okay with making the third interceptor be just as fast as the Saracen, improving only on combat performance.

[11:31] <KillDoor> or at least there should be more valuable parameters. Like with armour.

[11:31] <BTAxis> But it should not be actually SLOWER.

[11:32] <Richlv> heh, stiletto still can't travlel outside base radar range much

[11:32] <BTAxis> Well, it shouldn't be able to go TOO far.

[11:32] <KillDoor> why not? if it will be first aircraft with alien technology.

[11:34] <BTAxis> Because like Richlv said, people wouldn't bother researching and building it.

[11:34] <BTAxis> Both players and "real" ingame people.

[11:34] <Richlv> grrrrr. i hate this bug when some sounds are played at max volume when volume is set to 0

[11:34] <BTAxis> No R&D division would produce a new design that was worse than the old one.

[11:34] <KillDoor> And, I guess aircrafts to have an "turning radius" of aircraft.

[11:34] <BTAxis> That's not yet implemented, but we do plan on having it.

[11:34] <BTAxis> Also firing arcs, of course.

[11:35] <Richlv> and given that i can't reproduce it reliably, it might sit there on the tracker for months, if not years

[11:35] <BTAxis> You could just rename the sounds dir.

[11:36] <geever> BTAxis, If we're speaking of aircraft. Could you check researchtree? Now every new craft can be researched after the first ufo.

[11:36] <KillDoor> not worse, better in general. in example, one aircraft is fast, but need to use a big place to manevrous, other is slower but really manoeuvrable. Has more slots, better armour and so on.

[11:37] <BTAxis> geever: I'll have a look. Not sure the prerequisites are done yet, though...

[11:37] <BTAxis> KillDoor: That sort of tradeoff isn't needed at the start of the game, only at the end. The first part of the game is all about teching up.

[11:37] <KillDoor> there is some commented code in cl_research.

[11:38] <BTAxis> Might be related to some of the special stuff we have planned.

[11:38] <BTAxis> Like "grey" topics.

[11:39] <KillDoor> why not? Ok. saracien should be as fast as next aircraft? or at least it should not have half of its speed.

[11:39] <geever> KillDoor, there are some at other places aswell (commented code). :)

[11:40] <geever> or #if 0-ed

[11:40] <KillDoor> not 12/18, but 15/20, with 17/23 at dragon

[11:41] <KillDoor> geever: yes, I know, I`ve meaned some commented code about conditions. I haven`t scoped it deeper

[11:41] <Richlv> BTAxis, i sync my copy from svn checkout, so i would also have to script this. awful :)

[11:41] <BTAxis> Sure, that would be okay, but keep in mind that the main issue with the speed values is that each interceptor should be able to "catch" some UFOs, then "barely catch" some others, and finally being outrun completely by the rest.

[11:43] <BTAxis> Richlv: True.

[11:48] <KillDoor> yes. any interceptor should be usable in some cases, not like current stiletto :-)

[11:48] <BTAxis> Stiletto can catch scouts and fighters, though.

[11:49] <KillDoor> now, after your changes?

[11:49] <BTAxis> And once the max speed stuff is implemented, also harvesters if it's lucky.

[11:49] <BTAxis> Yeah.

[11:49] <BTAxis> Stiletto goes 9.

[11:49] <BTAxis> Scout goes 7, fighter 8.

[11:49] <KillDoor> BTAxis: with they stats stiletto will be slightly unlucky :-D

[11:50] <Richlv> it still couldn't travel any reasonable distance in current trunk

[11:50] <KillDoor> they mean stiletto Vs harvester :-)

[11:50] <BTAxis> Yeah, going up against a harvester will need multiple stilettos.

[11:50] <KillDoor> I prefere to use multiple saraciens :-)

[11:50] <BTAxis> The Saracen is supposed to be the first real anti-harvester craft.

[11:50] <geever> BTAxis, What I dislike is you've removed the ability to send an interceptor to a map-position

[11:50] <BTAxis> And even then you'd preferably need more than one.

[11:51] <BTAxis> geever: Not my fault.

[11:51] <geever> now we can't cut down the route to catch them

[11:51] <KillDoor> geever: +1

[11:51] <BTAxis> geever: We are going to pretty much need that anyway, for the scout UAVs.

[11:51] <geever> I know

[11:52] <KillDoor> I like "patroll" action of interceptors in first UFOs, in example to look for alien bases

[11:53] <geever> I think that ^ was the reason the feature was removed :(

[11:53] <KillDoor> but what`s wrong with this feature?

[11:53] <BTAxis> Nothing, it's what we want to do in UFO:AI as well.

[11:54] <BTAxis> It'll be one of the principal uses of the scout UAVs.

[11:54] <KillDoor> so, it is just temporary regression?

[11:54] <BTAxis> I don't know. I had nothing to do with it.

[11:54] *** dantheman joined
[11:54] *** dantheman left
[11:55] <KillDoor> currently we can`t select an aircraft to "send to", or select a point on globe to "send to point".

[11:55] <geever> yeah, also 'start aircraft' is meaningless

[11:56] <BTAxis> I did argue against base finding at one point, but that was long ago. Winter changed my mind about it, and I've been supporting it ever since.

[11:57] <geever> maybe the code didn't follow the change :)

[11:57] <BTAxis> I don't know if it's even related.

[11:57] <BTAxis> We don't have bases yet as it is.

[11:57] <BTAxis> Let alone UAVs.

[11:58] <geever> I don't care uavs yes they're far away but intercept...

[11:59] <geever> s/yes/yet/

[12:00] <BTAxis> Though, I think stevenjackson was talking about a change to the interceptor pathing a while ago too.

[12:00] <BTAxis> Make them head off UFOs by default instead of flying straight towards them.

[12:00] <BTAxis> I wonder what happened to that.

[12:00] <Richlv> yes, somebody was talking about that

[12:00] <Richlv> either stevenjackson, or kracken

[12:00] <Richlv> would be nice to have indeed

[12:00] <Richlv> currently it just looks plain stupid ;)

[12:00] <Richlv> especially if the interceptor is slightly slower

[12:01] <Richlv> it goes to the current position of the ufo, then starts following it in an arc, only to see it get away...

[12:01] <BTAxis> Yeah.

[12:01] <geever> sometimes it has no use even start the interceptor :(

[12:03] <geever> only if the ufo targets you then...

[12:03] <geever> which is another problem...

[12:10] <Richlv> hmm. all models are gone from buy/sell menus

[12:11] <geever> all?

[12:11] <KillDoor> again?

[12:12] <Richlv> and in production as well

[12:13] <geever> I have (most of) them

[12:13] <Richlv> well, revision 20403

[12:13] <geever> r20405

[12:13] <Richlv> ah, no. in production only aircraft equipment models are missing

[12:13] <geever> They were missing before

[12:14] <geever> but aircraft models were in

[12:14] <geever> so some disappeared somehow...

[12:17] <Richlv> R_RegisterModelShort: Could not find: 'missile_tr20'

[12:17] <geever> that's an old issue

[12:18] <Richlv> geoscape/missile_tr20.tga

[12:18] <Richlv> so these are only in geoscape

[12:18] <Richlv> but no models are displayed also for rocket pods and such

[12:19] <Richlv> that were displayed before. and there are no error messages about those

[12:24] <geever> My suspect is confuncs handling (again)...

[12:24] <geever> but didn't check

[12:25] <Richlv> game slows down when selecting some item that wasn't selected before, so i guess it loads the model

[12:26] <KrackenO> Richlv: the speed of aircraft are already dispayed in km/h for player

[12:26] <BTAxis> Isn't that supposed to be precached?

[12:26] <KrackenO> and operationnal range are displayed in km

[12:26] <KrackenO> (that is -- unless I forgot the conversion somewhere)

[12:27] <Richlv> BTAxis, it sort of is, and i have that option marked

[12:27] <Richlv> but it still slows down

[12:27] <Richlv> KrackenO, yeah, i know. i was just noting that this should never change to degrees or something ;)

[12:27] <BTAxis> Speaking of the aircraft stats, I noticed the info panel when an aircraft is flying, but it has a thing to the side that looks like a scrollbar.

[12:27] <BTAxis> I couldn't interact with it in any way though.

[12:27] <BTAxis> Is that an unfinished feature?

[12:28] <KrackenO> oh, I missunderstood what you said then ;)

[12:28] <KrackenO> BTAxis: the wheel should work (it worked last week)

[12:28] <BTAxis> Oh, of course.

[12:28] <BTAxis> The mouse wheel gestapo is on the move again.

[12:29] <BTAxis> First they take away my click repeat on the geoscape, now I can't get to the info without buying a different mouse.

[12:30] <BTAxis> Well, I didn't try mouseemu.

[12:30] <BTAxis> But I shouldn't have to

[12:30] <KrackenO> yes. you should be able to drag the scrollbar

[12:31] <KrackenO> (I mean not yet, but in the future)

[12:31] <BTAxis> Yeah, that goes for all scrollbars.

[12:31] <geever> BTAxis, click repeat came back :)

[12:31] <BTAxis> It wasn't back when I tried it just now.

[12:31] <BTAxis> But maybe I did it wrong or something.

[12:31] <BTAxis> I'll check again.

[12:32] <geever> maybe it's not as smooth as before

[12:32] <geever> it starts slow

[12:32] <BTAxis> Doesn't work at all here.

[12:33] <BTAxis> I'm on r20405.

[12:33] <BTAxis> I held down the button for 5 seconds, no repeat.

[12:33] <geever> on buy screen I have

[12:33] <BTAxis> Oh, yeah, it does work on the buy screen.

[12:33] <Richlv> hmm, btw. "Actors speed" - that form doesn't look correct to me

[12:33] <BTAxis> I'm talking only about the geoscape controls here.

[12:34] <geever> strange mouse you have

[12:34] <Richlv> shouldn't it be "Actors' speed" or something ?

[12:34] <BTAxis> Richlv: Where?

[12:35] <Richlv> BTAxis, options -> game

[12:35] <BTAxis> Then it should be "Actor speed".

[12:37] <KrackenO> BTAxis: geever: I've noted the bug of disappearing ability to send an aircraft to a point of a map, and the need to make interceptor fly toward it's target

[12:37] <KrackenO> I'll try to take of that in the next days

[12:37] <BTAxis> That would be great.

[12:37] <Richlv> BTAxis, will you change that text ?

[12:37] <BTAxis> Okay.

[12:42] <Richlv> god i want dropdowns instead of these switch controls :E

[12:42] <Richlv> they are a very, very bad idea from usability point of view

[12:42] <BTAxis> Oh, not this again.

[12:47] <Richlv> what this ? :)

[12:47] <BTAxis> This crusade against switch controls.

[12:49] <Richlv> well, they suck

[12:49] <Richlv> a lot

[12:49] <Richlv> and make no sense

[12:49] <Richlv> if space is so scarce, then a proper dropdown is much better

[12:50] <BTAxis> You said that, and I disagree.

[12:50] <BTAxis> Switch controls are preferrable dropdowns in specific situations, and the buy/sell menu qualifies as such.

[12:50] <BTAxis> +to somewhere.

[12:52] <Richlv> the problems with these controls (inability to see what options are available, inability to know what section will buttonpress open) are too great

[12:52] <Richlv> i always click back and forth to find the needed category

[12:52] <BTAxis> See, that's the point.

[12:53] *** NineX left
[12:53] <BTAxis> The point of switch controls is NOT to navigate to a specific page.

[12:53] *** NineX joined
[12:53] *** ChanServ sets mode: +v NineX

[12:53] <BTAxis> It's to leaf through all pages.

[12:53] <BTAxis> You put the cursor on the button, move your eyes to where the info is (usually the whole screen) and click through it all.

[12:53] <BTAxis> To check for anything that needs your attention.

[12:54] <BTAxis> It's like that with e.g. Civilization cities as well.

[12:54] <BTAxis> I'd *hate* to have to use a dropdown to leaf through them.

[12:54] <BTAxis> Two clicks for every change, need to shift attention to the control as opposed to the useful information...

[12:55] <geever> I wanted to put a multiline tooltip on the buyCategories to aid this but also wanted to change it dynamic and color the current which I couldn't figure out how to do yet.

[12:56] <geever> I'll see if it's possible...

[12:57] *** KillDoor left
[13:03] *** NineX left
[13:03] <Richlv> BTAxis, cities are different because there are many of them and the count is not defined

[13:04] <Richlv> here, count is static and there are at most 6 or so items in the list

[13:04] <Richlv> and usually you do not look at all of them, you navigate to that menu with a specific desire to buy a particular item

[13:04] <BTAxis> A low count actually is a reason AGAINST dropdown lists, mind you.

[13:05] <BTAxis> The less items, the less point having a list.

[13:05] <Richlv> and while dropdown would be 2 clicks, it would still be waaaaay better than current clickthrough system which takes more time always

[13:05] <BTAxis> Because it'll be just as fast/faster to leaf to the one you want.

[13:05] <Richlv> one thing where i can live with such switch control is aircraft switch in main base view

[13:06] <Richlv> there count is usually low, and look trumps usability

[13:07] <geever> Hmm, It seems tooltips are limited to 5 lines :(

[13:07] <geever> or buggy

[13:08] *** NineX joined
[13:08] *** ChanServ sets mode: +v NineX

[13:08] <Richlv> while tooltip would help somewhat, it would still be a hack for a usability problem which should not be there in the first place

[13:09] <Richlv> geever, btw, mousewheel doesn't work on aircraft selection controls in main base view - can you do something about that ? :)

[13:10] <Richlv> and, one thing that could be helpful while i'm fighting those dreaded switch controls ;> - can you do it so that if there's only one item in the list, these controls are inactive & dimmed ?

[13:10] <Richlv> for example, aircraft equip screen when there's only single aircraft in the base

[13:34] <geever> what about removing buttons if only one craft? Easier a bit. :)

[13:37] <geever> Richlv, ^ ?

[13:39] <Richlv> geever, frankly i wouldn't like that ;)

[13:39] <Richlv> disappearing options is another bad ui idea :)

[13:41] <BTAxis> Greying out is okay though.

[13:48] <geever> ok, you have to wait a bit for that, I should go away soon, and it seems I'll have to draw disabled buttons

[13:50] <geever> Hey, somebody bug-spamming the tracker ;)

[13:51] <geever> (and I think does some duplicates either)

[13:51] <Richlv> yep, greying out is preferred

[13:52] <Richlv> geever, quite possible, though i try to search for those ;)

[13:54] *** Kildor joined
[14:00] <Richlv> geever, should i report button dimming & mousewheel over aircraft list on the tracker ?

[14:01] <Richlv> both ?

[14:02] <geever> yes. About dupes, check:

[14:02] <geever> * radar overlay state not restored after loading

[14:03] <geever> * missing models

[14:20] <BTAxis> Only thing missing is UAVs.

[14:21] <BTAxis> No, still working on that.

[14:22] <Kildor> and aircraft statistics in wiki is wrong now?

[14:23] <BTAxis> Yeah. As long as balancing isn't finished they're meaningless.

[15:29] <Richlv> haha. it looks like stingray flies faster than rockets it fires

[15:29] <Richlv> BTAxis, could it be like that ?

[15:31] <BTAxis> Maybe. I haven't touched the weapon speeds.

[15:31] <BTAxis> What rockets are these, though?

[15:31] <BTAxis> The low tech ones?

[15:37] <Richlv> yes

[15:38] <Richlv> sparrowhawks

[15:41] <BTAxis> I wouldn't call it an issue just yet, then.

[15:42] <BTAxis> The Stingray it the best interceptor in the game, and it doesn't show up until the late game.

[15:42] <BTAxis> By that time, the Sparrowhawks will have been rendered obsolete.

[15:43] <BTAxis> We could even prohibit the Stingray from equipping any non-alien based weaponry.

[16:16] <nairan> hi

[16:22] <Richlv> true

[16:22] <Richlv> maybe allowing only particular tech to be equipped is the best solution here\

[16:23] <Senya_B]> why? ...... craft can fly faster then his weapons ;)

[16:24] <BTAxis> Sure, there's no reason why that shouldn't be possible, but by that time UFOs will fly just as fast, so the weapon will never actually hit anything.

[16:27] <Senya_B]> then must be added information about flying speed

[16:27] <Senya_B]> of weapon

[16:27] <Senya_B]> mean missle

[16:28] <BTAxis> Mmm.

[16:28] <Senya_B]> and player can see what real heppens and why weappon s are not effective

[16:29] <Senya_B]> there can be slow missles with low speed and otherwise

[17:13] *** CAK joined
[17:19] <KrackenO> BTAxis: is it intended that radar installation cannot detect alien missions on ground (such as ground reckon mission, subverting gov. mission, ...)?

[17:20] *** Xedge joined
[17:20] <KrackenO> they can only detect UFO at the moment, not missions (I mean not locations where you can send a dropship)

[17:21] <mattn2|home> how are they detected at all?

[17:21] <KrackenO> by base radar

[17:22] <KrackenO> the installations I mention are the small installation you can build on geoscape -- not the facilties you build in base

[17:22] *** CAK left
[17:22] <mattn2|home> hm. then i think it wouldn't make much sense to not allow the installation radar to detect then - we can't build bases all over the globe to detect them, no? but that's something BTAxis has to answer ;)

[17:23] <BTAxis> Bases shouldn't be detected by base radars.

[17:23] <BTAxis> But aircraft should have a chance of spotting them.

[17:23] *** Xedge left
[17:23] <BTAxis> As for normal missions, all radars should detect them. Terror missions should be detected immediately even if outside radar range.

[17:24] <KrackenO> that's already the case for terror mission

[17:24] <BTAxis> Okay, good.

[17:24] <KrackenO> I'll fix the radar of installation to make them detect other missions

[17:25] <BTAxis> One thing about that though.

[17:25] <BTAxis> The mission should be detected immediately if the UFO was detected. Otherwise, detect the mission with the same probability as the UFO every detection cycle.

[17:26] <BTAxis> And if there was no UFO to begin with, of course.

[17:26] <KrackenO> damn, that means I must change all the code :(

[17:27] <BTAxis> Really?

[17:27] <BTAxis> Hmm.

[17:27] <KrackenO> I'll check, but I don't think it's straightforward

[17:27] <BTAxis> We COULD instantly detect missions if they are in radar range...

[17:28] <BTAxis> It just makes sense to me that you wouldn't immediately spot the UFO on the ground if you didn't spot it in the air.

[17:29] <bobbens> should be harder to spot a landed ufo then a flying one

[17:29] <KrackenO> yes, but on the gameplay side it may be very fustrating to have mission close to your base that you can't detect

[17:29] <BTAxis> That's true.

[17:31] <bobbens> so don't make it that much harder to spot :)

[17:32] <nairan> cia not workin?

[17:32] <BTAxis> Nope.

[17:34] <KrackenO> on the other hand, as long as we keep a probabilty to see UFO ~ 40% each 30 minutes, you're nearly sure to detect a UFO that is close to your base

[17:35] <KrackenO> (closer than half the radar range)

[17:35] <KrackenO> the mission you could miss are only the mission on the border of your radar coverage

[17:35] <BTAxis> I don't want to make the chance depend on proximity to the radar though.

[17:35] <KrackenO> me neither

[17:36] <KrackenO> but that's a side effect of the probablity you added: a UFO that want to go to your base must spend at least a few hours in your radar coverage

[17:36] <KrackenO> so that means several roll with this 40% probability

[17:36] <KrackenO> and therefore a high chance to be located

[17:37] <bobbens> chance depending on proximity makes sense though

[17:37] <KrackenO> well, IMO this sideeffect is good

[17:37] <bobbens> you get much less noise on close radar readings

[17:38] <KrackenO> you may be unable to locate a UFO on the border of your radar coverage, but you're quite sure to locate a UFO flying over your base

[17:38] <BTAxis> Well, you're not SURE to locate it.

[17:39] <BTAxis> But odds are that you will.

[17:39] <bobbens> unless the UFO has some sort of stealth technology, your chance should be pretty high

[17:40] <BTAxis> I may adjust the probability a bit because aircraft speed comes into it as well.

[17:40] <BTAxis> The slower UFOs fly, the more checks.

[17:40] <BTAxis> But for now 40% works fine for me.

[17:41] <KrackenO> for me too

[17:44] <KrackenO> I think I've found a way to make that check (proability to detect mission)

[17:45] <BTAxis> Is it also possible to set the detection flag for the corresponding UFO?

[17:45] <KrackenO> what do you mean?

[17:45] <BTAxis> If you detect the mission, you should also detect the UFO (if there is one of course).

[17:45] <BTAxis> So when it flies off, you can track it.

[17:46] <KrackenO> oh, I have to check that

[17:49] <KrackenO> that should be possible

[17:49] <KrackenO> I'll try

[19:25] <BTAxis> There are test installers available, you can get them on the Windows forum.

[19:32] <RudolfoWood> but outdated only some weeks, not like 2.2.1 :-)

[19:38] <BTAxis> Unfortunately, those weeks might only mean that pathfinding is broken.

[20:19] <RudolfoWood> I thought that image + texh/texl + condition must be provided for such

[20:39] <bayo_O> yes, thats true

[20:39] <RudolfoWood> legal in france? in germany you would get problems

[20:39] <Richlv> bayo_O, btw, controls should never disappear from the gui

[20:40] <Richlv> ok, in some very rare cases maybe :)

[20:40] <Richlv> but in general that confuses users a lot and has been discarded in many applications before

[20:40] <RudolfoWood> I don't know wheter it would be better to have flexible nodes (such as buttons supporting pic-button + custom button) or different buttons for pic + text

[20:40] <RudolfoWood> Richlv, I made some buttons in production invisible when not applicable, but making them disabled would be the better solution

[20:41] <RudolfoWood> I did not do any graphics yet, so it is hard for me to create appropriate pics for such

[20:43] *** bayo__O joined
[20:44] <RudolfoWood> will we get bayo_________O?

[20:44] <bayo__O> one day one day

[20:45] * RudolfoWood is glad that umts is quite stable last weeks

[20:46] <bayo__O> umts?

[20:48] <RudolfoWood> I am connected via UMTS, yes

[20:49] <RudolfoWood> no DSL or other network available here... and I did not want to use analog 56k

[20:49] *** Nazgul02 left
[20:52] <Richlv> RudolfoWood, definitely

[20:53] <Richlv> also, maybe it's worth providing two mechanisms - one, custom enabled/disabled button

[20:53] <Richlv> two - enabled button image and runtime generation of greyscale disabled version

[20:54] <bayo__O> he is just tired to update texl/texh, no more

[20:54] <Richlv> second method would be a cheap way to quick development, and probably reduced ondisk size a bit ;)

[20:55] <Richlv> first would be best used in cases where we want the disabled button to differ more than just colour

[20:58] *** bayo_O left
[20:59] <RudolfoWood> these two mechs could be added to one button: if disabledimage is definied, it is used; otherwise greyscales would be calculated on-load

[21:01] <mattn2|home> bayo__O: the game isn't starting for me anymore - due to some supermenu error for ahud

[21:02] <bayo__O> mattn2|home : what it say?

[21:03] <CIA-23> tlh2000 * r20418 /ufoai/trunk/src/client/menu/m_main.c: * removed Sys_Error - as the calling function should handle this (and that's what the calling functions are doing already)

[21:03] <mattn2|home> Error: MN_ParseMenu: menu 'althud' can't inherit from menu 'ahud' - because 'ahud' was not found

[21:03] <mattn2|home> bayo__O: that's with latest revision ^^

[21:04] <bayo__O> well :/ maybe your computer dont sort files like me

[21:04] <mattn2|home> bayo__O: they are qsorted

[21:04] <mattn2|home> also there is no menu named ahud

[21:04] <bayo__O> hooo sorry i missed a file :D

[21:04] <mattn2|home> hehe

[21:06] <Richlv> <RudolfoWood> these two mechs could be added to one button: if disabledimage is definied

[21:06] <Richlv> yes, that's exactly what i meant :)

[21:06] <mattn2|home> bayo__O: could you commit it please? ;)

[21:07] <RudolfoWood> "computer says 'No'"

[21:07] <Richlv> RudolfoWood, wha ? :)

[21:07] <RudolfoWood> I love "Little Britain"

[21:07] <bayo__O> it come, i always need to look at help for native eol

[21:08] <CIA-23> bayo-fr * r20419 /ufoai/trunk/base/ufos/menu_ahud.ufo: * add missing file

[21:08] <RudolfoWood> mattn2|home, bayo__O: is init function of menu a redone in this sequence: push menu a, push menu b, do something in b, pop

[21:08] <RudolfoWood> ?

[21:10] <mattn2|home> not sure what happens on a pop - but afair yes (as always i might be wrong here - have a look at MN_PopMenu

[21:10] <bayo__O> RudolfoWood : when we return to the 'a' menu ?

[21:10] <RudolfoWood> yes

[21:11] <bayo__O> no it dont

[21:11] <bayo__O> i just check MN_PopMenu m_main.c

[21:13] <RudolfoWood> that is the problem for "incorrect aircraft displayed after selling one" bug... old referenced ufo is deleted, but cvars still hold that values...

[21:14] <RudolfoWood> with another call to init this could be solved easily I think

[21:14] <Richlv> heh. yeah, i flooded the report system a bit :)

[21:14] <Richlv> i don't understand how the hell will we get to a release :D

[21:14] <RudolfoWood> no problem, just some easy bugs to fix for me :-)

[21:14] <bayo__O> its not a good idea to call it from the core menu

[21:14] <Richlv> yes, most seemed pretty simple

[21:14] <RudolfoWood> feature-freeze :-)

[21:15] <Richlv> RudolfoWood, 'old referenced ship', not ufo in this case

[21:15] <RudolfoWood> yes, ship... where did you read ufo? :X

[21:19] <RudolfoWood> Opera gives up on that side, IE7 loads it after some very long time...

[21:22] <RudolfoWood> ouch - I pressed pastebin.ca/slepp.php and found a search page "that content does not exist" showing some content of index.php for this site with database connection details...

[21:23] <CIA-23> bayo-fr * r20420 /ufoai/trunk/src/client/menu/m_node_custombutton.c: * allow to texture more buttons in one texture

[21:32] <NineX> mattn2|home: http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=247509 <- look at this , any ideas?

[21:33] <Richlv> bayo_O, btw, why did you think that fixing incorrect selection when using spinner isn't important ?

[21:33] <Richlv> RudolfoWood, for me, pastebin.com often timeouts, .ca rarely had any problems

[21:34] <Richlv> using only opera/linux :)

[21:34] <Richlv> i don't think site accessibility is (in this case) browser dependent

[21:34] <RudolfoWood> I had no problems with .com til now

[21:34] <Richlv> maybe some inter-isp routing

[21:34] <Richlv> RudolfoWood, oh, share/report the php details ;D

[21:35] <bayo_O> Richlv: , because the user dont select anything

[21:35] <RudolfoWood> I think I won't paste them here to make them visible to everyone... but "blank" is no good password :-)

[21:36] <Richlv> NineX, oh. that bug is reported by flameeyes

[21:36] <Richlv> maybe a difficult person in some regards, but very bright one :)

[21:37] <Richlv> xine developer

[21:37] <Richlv> bayo_O, um, user acts on that item. it's quite cool the way you implemented it, i like that ;)

[21:38] <Richlv> RudolfoWood, report it to site owner then

[21:38] <NineX> Richlv: i have problem when my march is set to i686 compiler put me a error that tels me i have sse comands disabled

[21:39] <RudolfoWood> did that... the owner has no real contact information on this site as that site is broken... but I found it with google (as google finds everyone)

[21:39] <mattn2|home> NineX: sorry - i don't know

[21:39] <mattn2|home> but this isn't working yet

[21:39] <mattn2|home> let me know if you find the bug

[21:40] <mattn2|home> should be something obvious which i just don't see right now

[21:40] <mattn2|home> cu later

[21:40] <mattn2|home> going to bed now
