[02:23] <LeVaJe> Does anyone know how to build UFO:IA's GTKRadiant in Windows?

[02:27] <BTAllies> Yeah, with Code::Blocks.

[02:27] <BTAllies> Refer to the wiki for instructions.

[02:28] <LeVaJe> To compile the included GTKRadiant, you have to pass --enable-gtkradiant flag to configure, then issue make.

[02:29] <LeVaJe> How do I do that?

[02:32] *** Kildor joined
[02:52] <LeVaJe> I have compiled the game but I cannot find the GTKRadiant .EXEs. There is a line with --enable-gtkradiant in the configure file, do I need to something with that?

[16:43] <ghosta> BTAxis?

[16:44] * ghosta pokes BTAxis with a stick

[16:46] * BTAxis explodes, killing thousands

[16:47] <ghosta> uhm regarding the RMA stuff

[16:47] <ghosta> do you want to make your desert map random map assemblied or not?

[16:47] <BTAxis> Yes.

[16:47] <ghosta> therefore I would suppose the ds_hill_a and b.map are a waaaay too big

[16:48] <BTAxis> Why?

[16:48] <ghosta> if you dont want to make a "RMA" map like Africa or Japan

[16:48] *** BTAxis sets mode: +o mattn2|home_

[16:48] <ghosta> having big tiles means less randomness

[16:49] <BTAxis> No it doesn't.

[16:49] <BTAxis> It just means the tiles are bigger.

[16:49] <BTAxis> It can be as random as you want, as long as you have the tiles.

[16:50] <ghosta> but the code prefers big tiles

[16:50] <BTAxis> I know.

[16:50] <ghosta> this would mean the tile would appear in every map

[16:50] <BTAxis> But in the desert tileset there aren't too many restrictions.

[16:51] <BTAxis> So even if you force the tile to show up only once (or not at all), it won't get stuck.

[16:51] <BTAxis> It's easy enough to ensure the same tile won't be in every assembly by making multiple assemblies.

[16:51] <ghosta> hm let me upload some pictures how I would like to assemble the desert map ok?

[16:52] <BTAxis> Sure.

[16:58] <ghosta> http://ufoai.ninex.info/forum/index.php?topic=3143.0

[17:00] <ghosta> It took me around 1 hour to create 16 of the tiles and I just used heights ranging from 0 to 64. If you create more of them with the heights ranging from 64 to 128 you can see the "hills" better.

[17:03] <BTAxis> Yeah, but then you can only get that random-looking bumpy terrain.

[17:03] <BTAxis> That's not what I want.

[17:03] <BTAxis> I want some serious hills and sand dunes as well.

[17:04] <BTAxis> Also, if you don't make the edges uniform you're going to need to add a lot of restrictions to the ump file.

[17:04] <BTAxis> That's not good.

[17:04] <BTAxis> The fewer rules the better.

[17:05] <ghosta> you just need 2 variables for a height from 0 - 64 and 3 variables for 0 - 128

[17:06] *** tchristney joined
[17:06] <ghosta> I tested it some time ago and it worked quite fast for a height ranging from 0 - 128

[17:06] <ghosta> But I noticed some problems with the compiler

[17:06] <ghosta> you can see gaps between the brushes

[17:07] <BTAxis> I think gensurf does something wrong somehow.

[17:07] <BTAxis> There were issues when I made my hills as well.

[17:07] <ghosta> hm no its not gensurf

[17:07] <ghosta> its the compiler

[17:07] <ghosta> it doesent like to work with angular edges

[17:08] <ghosta> thats why I am crying for a mass merge tool :)

[17:09] <BTAxis> I thought blondandy did something like that for ufo2map.

[17:10] <ghosta> he wanted to but he couldn't spare some time for this

[17:12] <ghosta> I also tried making some tiles with sanddunes , but if you connect them they look ugly and weird :(

[17:12] <BTAxis> I know.

[17:12] <BTAxis> I tried that as well.

[17:12] <BTAxis> That's why I went with big hill tiles instead.

[17:14] <ghosta> However when the merge tool is available I am going to create a map with this terrain. With gensurf it will only take 2 or 3 days. It will work well as placeholder.

[17:15] <BTAxis> Well, I think you shouldn't bother. It doesn't look very good.

[17:15] <BTAxis> It's just bumpy and slightly flowing on the bigger scale.

[17:17] <ghosta> Hm yes, but at least I want to try it

[17:17] <BTAxis> Okay, no problem.

[17:17] <BTAxis> It's not like I'm going to get around to my tiles anytime soon anyway.

[17:17] *** MrHase joined
[17:19] <BTAxis> Also, I don't know if you're up to it, but have you considered making a destroyed version of the bomber UFO?

[17:20] <ghosta> u mean as prefab?

[17:20] <BTAxis> Yes.

[17:21] <BTAxis> We're going to need one for the crash missions.

[17:21] <ghosta> Hm currently I am working on a city map

[17:21] <ghosta> But after it I can try (and learn how to work with particles...)

[17:22] <BTAxis> That would be great.

[17:22] <BTAxis> Because I don't think I could pull it off.

[17:28] <geever> hi

[17:30] <BTAxis> I don't use it.

[17:31] <BTAxis> It's very slow for me (probably a driver issue), but it's also got some things I don't like at all.

[17:31] <BTAxis> Such as the orange wireframe stuff you get when selecting brushes.

[17:31] <BTAxis> It gets in the way.

[18:56] <geever> bayo_O, I have a suspect reading this

[18:56] <bayo_O> a suspect?

[18:57] <geever> When we click on the button it disappears and another one appears so moving the mouse will call the first node's out and then the new node's in?

[18:57] <bayo_O> yes

[18:57] <geever> if so, then that's the problem here

[18:58] <geever> but your last patch giex this, no?

[18:58] <geever> s/giex/fixed/

[18:58] <geever> (sorry, cannot type :) )

[18:58] <bayo_O> no, my last patch do this behaviour

[18:59] <bayo_O> i can check how do javascript for a case like that, but maybe the hidden not will receive a "mouse leave"

[19:01] <geever> yes That would be the logical way

[19:04] <bayo_O> you can rewrite the size on the "in" of the second button?

[19:06] <geever> maybe

[19:06] <geever> why?

[19:07] <bayo_O> i dont know :) i dont check at all the code?

[19:07] <bayo_O> geever : are you working on?

[19:07] <geever> no I didn't touch this problem

[19:08] <bayo_O> else i can do something (new i understabd better scripting....)

[19:08] <bayo_O> new->now

[19:08] <bayo_O> not mine (buffer overflow) :D

[19:08] <geever> changing messagesystems's size is not good in the second button's in

[19:09] <geever> as we set different sizes w lclick and rclick

[19:10] <bayo_O> leftclick-> change size ; rightclick -> fixe the current size

[19:11] <geever> no, on the first button, lclick->open half-height, rclick->open full-height

[22:04] <geever> I've found out the problem with aircraft techs

[22:04] <geever> not so easy to fix

[22:05] <geever> I think I'll disable your new check for now

[22:05] <mattn2|home_> we need that check - otherwise it would segfault a line below ;)

[22:05] <mattn2|home_> what is the problem?

[22:06] <geever> on loading a game it syserrors on aircraft->tech

[22:06] <geever> http://pastebin.ca/1277268

[22:06] <geever> with a debug print I've found that aircrafts are loaded before techs

[22:06] <geever> so they cannot be linked

[22:07] <geever> if you start a new game, then load an old one it's not a problem

[22:07] <geever> but if you load a game first... :(

[22:07] <mattn2|home_> but they should not be shown in the menu without a tech assigned

[22:08] <mattn2|home_> to disabling the check is not a fix - just a hack to forget the bug

[22:08] <mattn2|home_> can you give me a savegame?

[22:08] <geever> the trunk was broken on 20605 where only that check was included

[22:08] <geever> it's easy to create either. start a game with base&equipment, save, exit, rerun, load..

[22:09] <geever> so disabling it will not be worse

[22:09] <geever> and ofc the bug should be fixed

[22:09] <geever> the trunk should be playable till then

[22:09] <geever> too

[22:11] <mattn2|home_> i would always vote for exiting out on bugs - because otherwise it's not annoying and won't be fixed asap ;)

[22:11] <mattn2|home_> let me first check it

[22:11] <mattn2|home_> have some free minutes

[22:11] <geever> should I send a savegame or you could manage it?

[22:12] <mattn2|home_> have managed it - will have a look tomorrow

[22:20] <peteran> mattn2|home_: (and others who may be interested) some two weeks ago i mentioned that i would take a look at the startup time and i have done that now...running windows_debug I can squeeze 1s (11s->10s) with a nicer R_FilterTextures or same for windows (5s->4s)...there are some milliseconds details to be had that i log, but those are the times i see exactly in c::b...some of you may remember i mentioned a figure of 9s for windows target earlier...as

[22:29] <peteran> Specifically related to R_FilterTextures: running (compiled with vc++ express) through a set of 4096x4096 images using old 6.4s, new 4.5s and 3.7s using intrinsics for sse...i spent (or wasted) a lot of evenings learning to use intrinsics and was almost ready to go full way with asm(), but in the end i at least learned something new...and the last time i did x86 assembly was before mmx was invented

[23:44] <BTAxis> Possibly radar overlay rendering.

[23:45] <peteran> i saw that code and didn't really like that...i suppose that is supposed to be some blurring, but the way it was implemented is...well...wrong in my opinion

[23:49] <BTAxis> I know a lot of people think the same way.

[23:49] <BTAxis> Kracken probably knows more about it than I do.

[23:51] <peteran> i may take a look at radar, but first ufo2map as that is the one i feel is and area i should know how to do something nice

[23:52] <BTAxis> Okay.

[23:54] <peteran> i mean, i've been up and down a couple of times through a number of call graphs in vtune and ufo2map is easier than the game itself to get a grip on
