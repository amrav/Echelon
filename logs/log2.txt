[08:32] <artagnon> yeban: All hopes of long-term sustainability wrt CIC policies lie with KLUG.

[08:32] <artagnon> sanket: Do be involved.  Should we go meet PM sometime soon?

[08:32] <artagnon> ie. Should we push him a bit -- he hasn't replied yet.

[08:33] <yeban> artagnon: I think you should.

[08:33] <sanket> Yes so how did the situation get here, my version:

[08:33] *** quantumelixir left
[08:34] <artagnon> Please don't cook up pragmatic doomsday theories. We're all very good at it, and it's fairly unproductive.

[08:34] <sanket> Okay let it be here.

[08:34] <sanket> PM is a dead end.

[08:34] <artagnon> Oh.

[08:34] <artagnon> Ouch.

[08:34] <sanket> He listens to guys like Shibabroto - that's dead end for me.

[08:35] <yeban> sanket: Is Shibabroto that bad?

[08:35] <artagnon> I think it's possible to persuade people like Shibabroto a bit -- atleast from the conversation I had with him.

[08:35] <sanket> He does not know much, the mail clearly showed their lack of competence.

[08:35] <artagnon> Yes, not knowing is not a crime.

[08:35] <artagnon> Not willing to learn is.

[08:36] <sanket> Right. It's not a crime.

[08:36] <sanket> What sort of talk was it ?

[08:36] <artagnon> Nobody knows anything.  That's fairly well-established.

[08:36] <artagnon> Talk? I haven't spoken to him yet.  I meant the email thread.

[08:36] <sanket> Ok.

[08:36] <artagnon> He didn't seem like the irrational-hostile person.

[08:36] <artagnon> I've seen far worse people on lists :)

[08:37] <sanket> To me that mail was one of the peppy-nescafe chat. You won't believe it but PM spends half his time chatting to Shibabroto.

[08:37] <yeban> sanket: I think we should give him atleast one meeting with us.

[08:37] <sanket> Yes. Sure.

[08:37] <sanket> But again, what will be the agenda.

[08:37] <artagnon> I see.

[08:37] <yeban> See if they can align with our vision.

[08:37] <artagnon> sanket: It's difficult to plan for such a meeting.

[08:37] * sanket nods.

[08:37] <yeban> If they can help us with CIC.

[08:37] <artagnon> Yes, loosely what yeban says.

[08:38] <artagnon> If the time investment is too much, forget it.  Otherwise, try to push them to learn a bit.

[08:38] <artagnon> I think we can figure that out in one meeting.

[08:38] <yeban> Those who go to meet will have to bring these up. It is going to be a converstaion and not a monlogue, so it is difficult to plan in advance.

[08:39] <artagnon> Okay, maybe we'll waste two.  But I think it's worth pursuing -- I don't want our juniors to be stuck behind a horribly restrictive firewall.

[08:39] <artagnon> The way things are going, that's how it's going to end up.

[08:39] <sanket> yeban, You always plan to have your points in advance.

[08:39] <artagnon> sanket: Don't worry about that bit ;)

[08:39] <yeban> artagnon: Depending on the first meeting we can decide whether it makes sense to pursue it or not.

[08:39] <sanket> artagnon, If that's the motivation of the meet. I am very enthusiastic.

[08:39] <artagnon> I'm prepared.

[08:39] <artagnon> sanket: Yes, it is.

[08:39] <sanket> But again just to help you, CIC is not popular with CSE.

[08:40] <sanket> I can tell you one guy who can actually help you - ISG.

[08:40] * artagnon nods

[08:40] <artagnon> I know.

[08:40] <artagnon> :facepalm:

[08:40] <artagnon> We'll try him again.

[08:40] <yeban> sanket: Do you think ISG will be a better contact person for this?

[08:40] <artagnon> I was thoroughly disappointed with him last time.

[08:40] <diffoperator> I am a bit out of the loop here.

[08:40] <sanket> Right. I got a Public IP through CIC.

[08:40] <sanket> In 10 days. That's something I can never get for a long time :P

[08:40] <diffoperator> Whats going on?

[08:41] <sanket> Actually I had to set up a mailserver for CSE.

[08:41] <artagnon> diffoperator: We want to exert influence on CIC to make them more liberal.

[08:41] <artagnon> yeban: Right.

[08:41] <sanket> And if you have the backing of a prof, you can actually force things your way.

[08:41] <diffoperator> oh

[08:41] <sanket> artagnon, I can suggest something more sensible.

[08:41] <artagnon> Please do.

[08:41] <sanket> Why not make a body of students who can regulate proxy policies.

[08:42] <yeban> sanket: KLUG will do that.

[08:42] <sanket> I am pretty sure Alokesh won't mind. His hands are always too ful.

[08:42] <artagnon> That's what we're doing!

[08:42] <sanket> But that's one KLUG proxy.

[08:42] <artagnon> A clan within KLUG will do that.

[08:42] <yeban> sanket: No.

[08:42] <artagnon> Nope, insti-wide policies.

[08:42] <artagnon> We want to influence it.

[08:42] <sanket> Right.

[08:42] <sanket> yeban, artagnon: contradicting yourselves ?

[08:42] <yeban> No.

[08:42] <artagnon> Hm? How?

[08:43] <yeban> artagnon made the point.

[08:43] <sanket> Okay, maybe I am getting confused :)

[08:43] <yeban> So I didn't bother speaking again.

[08:43] <sanket> Yes. KLUG should do it.

[08:43] <yeban> sanket: Yeah.

[08:43] <sanket> But for Professors we should make it a point to have this committee somehow official.

[08:43] <artagnon> See: it's very difficult to build communities.  Building one is already difficult enough.

[08:43] <sanket> For example maybe it is headed by ISG himself.

[08:43] <artagnon> Clans within KLUG can do various productive things in the institute.

[08:43] <yeban> KLUG should be the visible tech group in the campus, and should have enough political influence to affect CIC policie.

[08:43] <artagnon> That's the entire larger vision.

[08:44] <sanket> Well that's obviously true.

[08:44] <sanket> IMO having support from CSE guys helps getting things in CIC enforced quickly.

[08:44] <artagnon> sanket: I'm against getting a prof to "control" the community at this stage.

[08:44] <artagnon> I disagree about it needing to be "official" or "blessed"

[08:44] <sanket> artagnon, ISG is very nice prof. It's not about "control".

[08:45] <sanket> It's about taking advantage of his position as well as understanding for the students.

[08:45] <artagnon> He'll arguably be a bad influence on the community if he brings in bad ideas.

[08:45] <sanket> He wants to help, but someone got to go up to him.

[08:45] <artagnon> It'll take us time to orient him.

[08:45] <artagnon> With the same vision.

[08:45] <yeban> artagnon: I am against it any stage.

[08:45] <sanket> artagnon, Do not make it that complicated :)

[08:45] <artagnon> It's not complicated at all.

[08:46] * yeban needs to study

[08:46] <artagnon> We just don't want to bring in a prof now.

[08:46] <yeban> artagnon: Let us discuss the rest over chai.

[08:46] <artagnon> yeban: Okay.

[08:46] <artagnon> Profs are old and outdated.  Many know very little about anything.

[08:46] <sanket> Then why go and talk to another prof.

[08:46] <sanket> artagnon, Agreed. Saw that in opensoft last year.

[08:46] <artagnon> Yes.

[08:46] <sanket> I am trying to exploit his position. With 0 compromise to any of our policies or ideology.

[08:46] <artagnon> And such a person is potentially harmful to the community.

[08:47] <sanket> artagnon, Infact he is harmless. :P

[08:47] <artagnon> It's a little difficult at this stage :)

[08:47] <sanket> Then good luck with CIC :)

[08:47] <artagnon> He's an authority figure, and you can't deny that.  People tend to respect him.

[08:47] <artagnon> yeban: Okay.

[08:47] <sanket> Yes. And most importantly he is ratainal.

[08:47] <sanket> rational*

[08:47] <artagnon> It's culturally ingrained into man Indians: Maata, Pita, Guru, Devam.

[08:48] <yeban> artagnon: From how much I know ISG, I will concur with sanket - he is harmless.

[08:48] <artagnon> It'll take some time to break that.

[08:48] <sanket> As you saw in last OpenSoft, he was simply unaware.

[08:48] <artagnon> Perhaps.

[08:48] <sanket> It's like a=>b, if A is false

[08:48] <sanket> B can't help it ;)

[08:48] <artagnon> So, we'll spend a couple of months with him.

[08:48] <artagnon> And let him absorb something.

[08:48] <artagnon> Then we can see what to do.

[08:49] <sanket> I don't think he should be anywhere near our agenda or our working.

[08:49] <sanket> Infact his only figure would be to help us get through CIC, or administrative stuff.

[08:49] <artagnon> True, but I think it's important for every member of the community to understand our vision.

[08:49] <sanket> A roll of the pen, pure exploitation if you might say.

[08:49] <artagnon> We don't want to "use" fringe members.

[08:49] <artagnon> No, I'm against that.

[08:50] <sanket> Well yes. That's all it is going to lead to.

[08:50] <sanket> Even if you share your vision, he is too old and relaxed to be upbeat about anything.

[08:50] <artagnon> Are you challenging?  Give us a couple of months and see.

[08:50] <artagnon> I don't understand why you're so unambitious!

[08:50] <sanket> I will be more than happy to be surprised :).

[08:50] <artagnon> Be ambitious! Be idealistic!@

[08:50] <artagnon> It doesn't hurt.

[08:51] <artagnon> Good.  We'll try then.

[08:51] <sanket> artagnon, You might have time. Unfortunately I am short of it.

[08:51] <artagnon> If it fails, we'll move to a less ideal route.

[08:51] <artagnon> No, I don't have time either.  I have tons of work.

[08:51] <artagnon> Yet, I give time to KLUG, because I think it's important.

[08:51] <artagnon> It's high on my personal priority list.

[08:51] <artagnon> It's important to have discussions and debates here.

[08:52] <sanket> Good to hear that.

[08:52] <artagnon> And argue certain things out.

[08:52] <sanket> On ISG issue, your hold is very correct and true.

[08:52] <artagnon> Can you imagine the scale of the change this'll bring about if it's totally succesful? :)

[08:52] <sanket> I was bringing the part which needs to be exercised now.

[08:52] <artagnon> I don't want "web teams" or "CIC teams" in KLUG to be separated from the rest of KLUG.

[08:53] <artagnon> Everyone must move forward with a joint vision.

[08:53] <artagnon> Oh, ok :)

[08:53] <sanket> But it's good to see the longer vision :).

[08:53] <artagnon> I've always loved writing code more than anything else in the world -- KLUG is taking time away from that, and it's a big sacrifice that I have to make.

[08:53] <sanket> I can write a mail to ISG, IMO which if replied leads to much more impact.

[08:53] <artagnon> sanket: You must believe that it's possible :)

[08:54] <sanket> If it does not get replied, I will call him up.

[08:54] <artagnon> sanket: I think we should meet him in person.

[08:54] <artagnon> How about today?

[08:54] <sanket> I can assure you a meet :).

[08:54] <artagnon> Ok.

[08:54] <sanket> I think we should give him time to think. Look what he did with OpenSoft <sigh>

[08:54] <sanket> And fix a meet for sure.

[08:55] <artagnon> Yes, sure.

[08:55] <artagnon> Don't be dismissive of things -- everything can be changed given enough time.  We just have to optimize and pour our time into the easy-change alleys.

[08:56] <sanket> I am going to write a mail and send it to the list. Everybody has today to do editions and then it goes to ISG tomorrow morning first thing.

[08:56] <artagnon> Sure.

[08:56] <artagnon> That'll be nice :)

[08:56] <artagnon> Thanks.

[08:56] <sanket> Sure.

[08:58] <artagnon> sanket: Also write about KLUG's collective responsibility to influence CIC policies in the long term for greater good in IIT Kharagpur.

[08:58] <artagnon> (In your own words) -- the way you feel about it.

[08:59] <artagnon> Writing helps think about it clearly.

[09:00] <artagnon> Also, I don't think it should be one prof -- we can spend a little time with a few promising CS profs including PM.  They'll talk amongst themselves too.

[09:00] <artagnon> And push each other to learn more.

[09:12] <sanket> Yes. NG is one such prof.

[09:13] <sanket> Luckily I am doing MTP under him, and have good allegiance with ISG.

[09:13] <artagnon> Awesome.  One more.  Make a "hitlist" :P

[09:13] <sanket> NG is one good prof. who has always wanted to hear student problems. Though he does not exercise much power as compared to ISG.

[09:14] <sanket> All the more he is a Kgpian so it all adds up :)

[09:15] <artagnon> Ah.

[09:15] <artagnon> Excellent.

[09:15] <artagnon> We have to plan out a strategy and execute it quickly and efficiently.

[09:24] <sanket> Infact for the enthusiastic a new machine has been brought into CSE. It's a 8 processor with 6 core each, i.e. 48 core machine.

[09:24] <sanket> With about ~ 40 GiG of ram.

[09:25] <sanket> The major concern which NG showed was that despite having the resources to set up cluster - and infact lots of spare machines, there is not much competence or the desires to do so.

[09:28] <artagnon> Nice :)

[09:28] <artagnon> We'll push people to share resources and use them effectively.

[09:30] <yeban> Can you _buy_ an iPhone that is not tied to a network?

[09:31] <yeban> No, I am not talking about the option of jail breaking, or asking the provider to unlock my phone.

[09:31] <artagnon> I don't think so.

[09:32] <artagnon> I'm not sure though -- they might be selling that nowadays.

[09:34] <artagnon> sanket: I've emailed Keshav Prawasi about KLUG, encouraging him to participate -- he was interested in something like this earlier.

[09:34] <sanket> artagnon, That's nice.

[09:35] <artagnon> I told Arjun Naidu about it too -- he's feeling a little bored/ down at the moment at work.

[09:36] <artagnon> As part of KLUG, it's our job to make new members feel welcome and comfortable :)

[10:09] <yeban> artagnon, aftab: Btw, I figured out that paper :). There are some good ideas in there. Not sure if it is worth struggling through the bad prose though.

[10:10] <artagnon> I see.

[10:10] <artagnon> Btw, a Linkedin Bangalore Technology Center is starting up.  They're looking to hire.

[10:10] <artagnon> Apply if interested.

[10:10] <yeban> Hmm.

[10:11] <yeban> I can actually. I like some of their technologies.

[10:11] <yeban> Need to explore more though.

[10:11] <artagnon> Also, nVidia is looking for a Git Engineer/ Administrator.

[10:11] <yeban> Voldemort for instance.

[10:12] <yeban> Besides, I heard Zynga India does good work.

[10:12] <yeban> The same might apply for LinkedIn as well.

[10:12] <artagnon> yeban: Let me know.  I know who to get in touch with.  Plenty of recruiters send me email.

[10:12] <yeban> artagnon: :D

[10:12] <yeban> arty is famous

[10:12] <artagnon> Nah, I'm just a final-year.  They head hunt.

[10:14] <artagnon> Atleast, that's what I hear from recruiters.

[10:15] <artagnon> On an unrelated note, put up some good TED talks on the KLUG/resources -- I've only put up three.

[10:16] <yeban> For those interested: LinkedIn is mostly about scaling.

[10:16] <yeban> The technological challenge, I mean.

[10:16] <artagnon> Same as FB I suppose.

[10:16] <yeban> They focus on scalability a lot.

[10:17] <yeban> No doubt, they have neglected the UI :|.

[10:17] * artagnon laughs

[10:17] <yeban> artagnon: Actually, you can generalize that to a most of the social networks.

[10:17] <artagnon> The UI is butt ugly.

[13:27] <artagnon> ashim: We haven't announced it yet.

[13:27] <ashim> Oh, i see. Thank You.

[13:27] <artagnon> I hope we can have it on Friday at the same time though.

[13:30] <artagnon> A couple of pending introductions: quantumelixir is (was) Chidambaram Annamalai and vickyc1 is Vicky Chijwani.

[13:31] <aftab> Who is "diffoperator"?

[13:31] <artagnon> Nikhil Sarda.

[13:31] <artagnon> aftab: See http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/klug-devel?date=2011-08-29#l178

[13:32] <artagnon> As more people come in, we'll probably have a dedicated page.

[13:34] <aftab> [aftab leaves for dinner]

[13:35] * artagnon leaves too

[13:35] <artagnon> Bah, hunger can't be planned :P

[13:43] *** aftab left
[13:57] <sanket> I have left the arrow towards the group. Hope that some part of it shall be left intact ;)

[14:13] <sanket> artagnon, Assuming you are managing the list. Can someone outside the list reply back. If not how do you do that.

[14:28] *** vighnesh joined
[14:28] <sanket> vighnesh, Welcome :)

[14:28] <vighnesh> hi - took your suggestion :)

[14:29] <sanket> I think not many people are around right now.

[14:29] <sanket> Btw you can use Xchat

[14:30] <sanket> It's much better if you do not want to keep the browser pane open all the time. Because your signature shows you are using web/freenode :)

[14:30] <vighnesh> ya i'm using freenode ... let me try xchat

[14:30] <artagnon> vighnesh: Welcome!

[14:31] <vighnesh> artagnon: hi :)

[14:32] <artagnon> And another introduction is in order: vighnesh is Vighnesh Avadhani.

[14:32] <artagnon> vighnesh: A partial list of people here -- http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/klug-devel?date=2011-08-29#l178

[14:32] <artagnon> Scourn the log for more, or just ask :P

[14:32] <artagnon> sanket: I don't know if Google Groups has that feature :|

[14:32] <vighnesh> ok thanks

[14:34] <sanket> Okay. But generally the lists are open. Do we have a closed list to avoid spam ?

[14:35] <artagnon> Yes.

[14:35] <artagnon> I know it's a little unfortunate, but Google Groups is not very good at handling spam.

[14:36] <artagnon> We should probably switch to something like Mojodormo in the long-term.

[14:36] <sanket> But I think an offline mail shall come to someone's moderation.

[14:36] <sanket> Or right now we have straight reject ?

[14:36] <artagnon> It does a straight reject now :|

[14:36] <artagnon> Shibabrito's mail never reached the list -- I had to forward it.

[14:36] <sanket> Too bad, this needs to fixed.

[14:36] <artagnon> Please see if it's possible to change that.

[14:37] <artagnon> Yes, definitely.

[14:37] * artagnon is reading Sanket's email now

[14:38] <artagnon> Nice email :)

[14:38] <artagnon> The text wrapping is horribly broken though :|

[14:38] <sanket> Blame google.

[14:39] <artagnon> I can't see ISG in the TO or CC -- why?

[14:39] <artagnon> ie. Is this a draft?

[14:39] <sanket> Yes. The list can give its suggestions.

[14:39] <sanket> As we discussed till about midnight.

[14:39] <artagnon> If so, could you clarify that with another short email?

[14:39] <artagnon> Yeah, I know that but everyone else doesn't :)

[14:40] <sanket> Oh, yes. I will reply to this email. Anyhow it is supposed to be a thread.

[14:40] * artagnon nods

[14:40] <ps_jinx> sanket: do you use mutt instead of gmail interface?

[14:40] <sanket> Right now using Gmail, thunderbird aint no good

[14:40] <artagnon> It doesn't wrap properly?

[14:40] <artagnon> I thought it did.

[14:41] <artagnon> Just don't try to wrap manually -- type out everything as one paragraph and I think it should handle it fine.

[14:41] <artagnon> Only introduce "\n\n" between two paragraphs.

[14:42] <sanket> Then it becomes to wide. But it will preserve the wrapping.

[14:42] <sanket> Doing that anyhow,

[14:42] <artagnon> As in, in the next emails.

[14:43] <artagnon> ps_jinx: (Do correct me if I'm wrong)

[14:43] <artagnon> I haven't used the GMail web interface much.

[14:45] <ps_jinx> yup if don't need to hit enter for wrapping the text, it will automatically get wrapped as you said whenever someone reads in gmail or anyother web interface for mails

[14:45] <artagnon> Ok, cool.

[14:45] <artagnon> Auto-wrap is very annoying when sending patches etc.

[14:45] <artagnon> And there's no way to turn it off in GMail.

[14:46] <sanket> So basically if I want to say, 80 columns - I cannot enforce it.

[14:46] <artagnon> So, when you want to impose a specific wrapping, you have to attach -- it's a bad hack, but there's not much else you can do unless you have access to SMTP.

[14:46] <artagnon> No.

[14:46] <sanket> That's simply sad.

[14:46] <artagnon> Yes.

[14:46] <sanket> I put it on plain text mode, hoping it would work.

[14:47] <sanket> Sent.

[14:47] <sanjoyd> M-q.  Emacs.

[14:47] <artagnon> :D

[14:47] <artagnon> Much nicer.

[14:48] <ps_jinx> yeah I will wrap manually while writing mail in vim .. and if i do copy paste after that it will be rendered badly on gmail interface .. it sux

[14:49] <artagnon> sanjoyd: M-q Emacs works if you have an email client.

[14:49] <sanjoyd> Yes.

[15:11] <artagnon> Virtuoso piano -- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MD6xMyuZls0 (via quantumelixir)

[15:32] *** diffoperator left
[16:05] <artagnon> Rewrite posted.

[16:05] <artagnon> Whew.  Email takes up SO much time.  Poor Linus.

[16:07] <artagnon> sanjoyd: Sorry, I didn't see your email until now :'(

[16:07] <artagnon> I couldn't include those points as explicitly in the rewrite.

[16:09] <sanjoyd> artagnon: oh, never mind. :)

[16:23] <vighnesh> artagnon: I think there's a small typo in the rewrite. Become should be replaced by becoming in " For instance, some of the CIC policies can move towards become more liberal" ...

[16:23] <artagnon> vighnesh: Nice! Thanks for catching! :D

[16:23] <vighnesh> ;)

[16:24] <artagnon> Please reply to the email and point that out.

[16:24] <vighnesh> ok

[16:24] <artagnon> vighnesh: Essentially, some practise in quoting :)

[16:25] <artagnon> And more participation (not everyone's listening here)

[16:28] <vighnesh> done :)

[16:29] <artagnon> Nice.  Thanks :)

[16:29] *** darthshak joined
[16:29] <artagnon> Um, you replied to me not KLUG :|

[16:29] <darthshak> oh?

[16:29] <artagnon> darthshak: Welcome! :)

[16:30] <darthshak> nice

[16:30] <artagnon> darthshak: Channel logs are publicly available (see topic)

[16:31] <vighnesh> artagnon: Oops - I just hit r, assuming it would go to the group. Resending

[16:32] <artagnon> np

[16:34] <darthshak> you've invited sowmyan as well?

[16:35] <artagnon> darthshak: I haven't told him yet -- do ask him to join in as well.

[16:35] <artagnon> Ah, time for another introduction. darthshak is Vishaka Datta.

[16:35] <darthshak> will do.

[16:35] <darthshak> yaay

[16:35] <darthshak> that's the first time in a while someone got the spelling right in the first go

[16:36] <artagnon> (Please join the mailing list so that people can look that up and see a small picture of you :P)

[16:36] <artagnon> :D

[16:36] <artagnon> I'm a little particular about these things :)

[16:36] <darthshak> sure

[16:37] <darthshak> hmm. going by the last few logs.

[16:37] <darthshak> i seem to have joined at an off-peak time?

[16:38] <artagnon> Not really -- activity usually comes in bursts.

[16:38] <artagnon> Someone says something interesting and the list explodes with activity :P

[16:38] <darthshak> Ah

[16:39] <darthshak> Ok, someone has to figure out why bursting bubblewrap is so damn interesting

[16:40] <sanket> artagnon, We can assign someone an interesting task of writing a bot.

[16:40] <artagnon> Yes, that's a good idea.

[16:40] <darthshak> A la eliza?

[16:40] * sanjoyd coughs.

[16:40] <sanket> I guess sanjoyd already has a prototype. With more participation and new comers, it'll be fun.

[16:40] <sanjoyd> So much for not using flyspell.

[16:40] <sanjoyd> sanket: I don't.

[16:40] <sanket> Oh that was yeban then ?

[16:40] <artagnon> sanket: Thanks.  I forgot to turn on flyspell.

[16:40] <sanket> Yes, gmail does decently well :)

[16:41] <artagnon> Also, pleas convert to plain text next time before posting.

[16:41] <artagnon> HTML email is not pretty.

[16:41] <sanjoyd> Wait!! You *DONT* like <blink> ?

[16:41] <artagnon> Most spam comes in HTML, and we can write a rule to filter it.

[16:42] <artagnon> darthshak: Not really like eliza -- see some other channels.

[16:42] <artagnon> Some of them are pretty simple.

[16:42] <darthshak> Ah ok

[16:43] <darthshak> artagnon: Did you manage to get down to checking out that Hodgkin-Huxley paper I was telling you about?

[16:44] <artagnon> Uh, no. I forgot.  Link perhaps?

[16:44] <sanjoyd> darthshak: you are?

[16:44] <artagnon> Vishaka Datta.

[16:44] <artagnon> You met him the other day in Aseem!

[16:44] <sanjoyd> I know.

[16:45] <darthshak> My my

[16:45] <darthshak> I'm more forgettable than I thought

[16:45] <sanjoyd> How am I supposed to make that out by the IRC nick?

[16:45] *** vighnesh left
[16:45] <darthshak> Yeah fair enough

[16:45] <artagnon> Scroll up?

[16:45] <artagnon> I put it up.

[16:46] <darthshak> Wiki link : https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Hodgkin–Huxley_model

[16:46] <darthshak> Actual paper : http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392413/

[16:46] <artagnon> Thanks, looking. sanjoyd would love to geek out on this :D

[16:46] <darthshak> One of those few papers that warrant reading

[16:47] <darthshak> Nice

[16:47] <artagnon> I'm going out to get some chai.  Badly overworked.

[16:47] <darthshak> Ah ok

[16:47] * artagnon goes off to get chai

[16:47] <artagnon> Call if you want to join (BCR or Carlos)

[16:48] <darthshak> Aftab and Chillu are calling me to RK now

[16:48] <darthshak> I'm a bit lazy to go though

[16:48] <darthshak> I think they'd be more than willing to join

[17:10] *** darthshak left
[17:46] <ashim> Artagnon: Perhaps adding sanjoy's point between line #2 and #3 of the 2nd para will make it explicit while mainitaining the logical flow. Just my 2 pence.

[20:34] <artagnon> ashim: Okay.  It'll require a bit of a rewrite anyway -- I was being lazy :P

[20:34] <artagnon> Will include it now.  Thanks.

[20:37] <ashim> :)

[20:37] <ashim> Can i help?

[20:37] <artagnon> ashim: Sure!  Just post a quick draft with the change on Pastie while I respond to Arindam's email.

[20:38] <ashim> Okay.

[20:38] <artagnon> I'll then pick it up from Pastie and introduce a few more changes from Arindam's email -- I have a little more context about the KLUG that existed previously.

[20:50] <ashim> http://pastie.org/2456374

[20:51] <artagnon> Thanks! :)

[20:51] <ashim> artagnon: ^ As i copied the text from Google Groups, the line ending are a problem. I just put in hard returns

[20:51] * artagnon is finishing the reply to Arindam first

[20:51] <artagnon> np, I'll fix it.

[21:11] <artagnon> ashim: I'm horribly overworked and need to sleep -- feel free to write another draft taking my response to Arindam's email into account and post it to the list.

[21:18] *** lupo33 joined
[21:18] <artagnon> sanket: Are you rewriting?  I really need to sleep a bit.

[21:18] <sanket> Sigh, not now. More network issues. Apparently the hub is down.

[21:18] <sanket> Can't ask for more work.

[21:18] <sanket> Fucking RK's server room.

[21:18] <artagnon> Oh, ok.  Don't worrya about it.

[21:18] <sanket> Nope, I will do it first thing morning.

[21:19] <sanket> But as I see we are going to make changes to it,

[21:19] <sanket> I will make another draft.

[21:19] <artagnon> Yeah.

[21:19] <sanket> And post it to the list soon.

[21:19] <artagnon> Yes.  Someone might choose to do it tonight.

[21:20] <artagnon> Good points about self-versioning and preserving different points of view btw.

[21:20] <artagnon> And excellent analysis by crodjer.
