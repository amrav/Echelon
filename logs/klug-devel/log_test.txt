[10:05] * artagnon shudders

[10:05] <lupo33> artagnon: At the thought of what?

[10:05] <artagnon> I just commented on a super-high-influence thread about Git Generation Numbers -- mainly a conversation between Linus, and the original authors.

[10:05] <lupo33> :)

[10:06] <artagnon> It took me some time to convince myself that what I was saying wasn't all garbage.

[10:07] <artagnon> http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/177146/focus=180783

[10:11] * lupo33 googles Git Generation Numbers

[10:12] <$$$> You'll find nothing :)

[10:12] <$$$> Except this thread, and a previous thread like this.

[10:13] <lupo33> http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2765844

[10:13] <sa1> :). In the first and last paragraphs, you sound like me when I am talking to you or Sanjoy. The middle paragraphs, of course, I have no clue about.

[10:13] * artagnon laughs

[10:14] <artagnon> Yes, that was the point of showing you this :)

[10:14] <sa1> :)

[10:15] <artagnon> It's perfectly normal behavior.  This is how the community grows.

[10:16] <artagnon> Note how I'm blatantly disagreeing with almost everyone except Linus :P

[10:16] <artagnon> It's very important to disagree.

[10:17] <sa1> artagnon: I disagree. :P

[10:17] * artagnon smiles

[10:17] <artagnon> Also, note how most less-useful responses on the thread are completely ignored.

[10:18] <artagnon> See the people Linus responds to.

[10:27] * lupo33 was wondering if a we could write code to make a simple s/foo/bar-like command to replace foo by bar in the channel log (and if possible in the live channel feed too).

[10:34] <artagnon> Sounds very similar :)

[10:36] <sa1> Yeah, I have read it. But still, he announced a _kernel_, which makes the the rest of the email rather secondary.:P

[10:40] <sa1> The same of course could be the case with your email, though I don't understand it.

[10:42] <artagnon> lol, I don't either -- and that isn't the point anyway.

[15:19] <diffoperator> sanjoyd: Are you writing GPython in C++?

[15:19] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: yes.

[15:19] <diffoperator> eschewed C?

[15:19] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: a lot has changed from what is there in the github account.  I'll probably re-write history.

[15:20] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: yes.  I'm a C++ fan now. :D

[15:20] <diffoperator> are your latest commits in?

[15:20] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: no.  I'll push once the lexer is written.

[15:20] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: or, actually I can push what I have now.

[15:20] <diffoperator> (you'll come back to java soon, the way you are going...)

[15:20] <diffoperator> yeah do that

[15:20] <$$$> diffoperator: you'll probably reconsider when you look at the code. :P

[15:21] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: it does not work, barely compiles.

[15:21] <sanjoyd> I'll push nevertheless.

[15:23] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: pushed.

[15:23] <$$$> ok

[15:24] <diffoperator> are you writing the lexer by hand?

[15:24] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: yes.  Actually I've cleaned up the one in CPython itself.

[15:24] <$$$> Now to tweak it until it runs.

[15:25] <sanjoyd> The CPython one is a huge function, with quite a few gotos.

[15:25] <$$$> I've removed all that.

[15:25] <sanjoyd> And I'm experimenting with the idea of turning the lexing + parsing the other way than usual.

[15:25] <sanjoyd> i.e. the lexer calls the parser when it has a token, and not the other way around.

[15:25] <sanjoyd> Right now, I don't know if this will work well.

[15:26] <diffoperator> huh? that is not the standard workflow

[15:26] <diffoperator> It shouldn't

[15:26] <sanjoyd> You mean the lexing + parsing?

[15:26] <artagnon> ashim: Thanks :)

[15:26] <diffoperator> 1

[15:26] <sanjoyd> No, not really.  Things do work unexpectedly.  For instance, v8 does not even have a lexer.

[15:26] <sanjoyd> It parses JS directly.

[15:27] <$$$> Are there any proofs on the efficiency and correctness of this method?

[15:27] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: which method?

[15:27] <sanjoyd> I'm not following any method.

[15:27] <diffoperator> of parsing directly

[15:27] <diffoperator> no the standard way of doing things is to use compiler compilers

[15:27] <sanjoyd> You'd have a hard time proving a C++ program. :D

[15:28] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: they're too slow for a JIT.

[15:28] <diffoperator> wow, with templates and all

[15:28] <diffoperator> oh right my bad

[15:28] <diffoperator> thats standard compiler theory

[15:28] <sanjoyd> Plus, compiler-compilers tend to work well with whitespace agnostic langauges.

[15:28] <sanjoyd> IMO.

[15:28] <diffoperator> how do things work for JIT compilers?

[15:28] <sanjoyd> I could not find a nice and elegant way to encode Python's indentation in lex.

[15:29] <diffoperator> is it possible to simply import V8?

[15:29] <diffoperator> i mean its architecture

[15:30] <diffoperator> or does the target language requires different way of doing things?

[15:39] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: sorry, was on the phone.

[15:39] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: give me a few minutes.

[15:40] <$$$> np

[15:44] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: I do intend to base the code on V8's architecture.  I've been hearing a bit on trace based JITs too; perhaps that will also be interesting to explore.

[12:55] <diffoperator> it looks usable

[12:55] <diffoperator> + it is maintained by adobe and mozilla

[12:56] <diffoperator> So essentially what the Firefox guys are planning to do is

[12:56] <diffoperator> javascript -> quickly generated but not that optimized code using nitro

[12:57] <diffoperator> nitro code -> slowly generated but fast machine code using nanojit

[12:57] <diffoperator> the last step applies for code that is marked as hot

[13:35] * artagnon nods

[13:35] <sanjoyd> Okay.

[13:36] <diffoperator> sanjoyd: I am currently reading nanojit code. When do you want to discuss this?

[13:37] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: I still have not seen the code, maybe in two hours?

[13:37] <diffoperator> ok

[13:38] <sanjoyd> I was actually thinking we should work on the lexer and parser; and focus on getting a CFG first.  Once that is out of the way and we actually have something to play with, these things will make more sense.

[13:38] <sanjoyd> It does make a lot of sense to get a library do the platform specific code gen, of course.

[13:39] <sanjoyd> Ahh ... too many 'actually's.

[13:39] <diffoperator> yeah, definitely

[13:39] <$$$> can you prepare some sort of a rough roadmap? I have only used lex and yacc in the past

[13:40] <sanjoyd> Okay.

[13:40] <sanjoyd> I'll do that.

[13:40] <diffoperator> so if you intend to do things differently, i will need to read up on some theory

[13:40] <diffoperator> or code

[13:40] <sanjoyd> Even I'm not very sure about many things right now. :)

[13:54] <diffoperator> np, we first try to get hello world to run

[15:03] <lupo33> Is Minix a high entry barrier project?

[15:11] <$$$> lupo33: try to look at the source, and see how much sense it makes.

[15:12] <sanjoyd> lupo33: you might want to contribute to some C project first, hacking on an OS can be pretty hardcore.

[15:17] <diffoperator> lupo33: It depends on how much time/energy you have to spare.

[15:18] <diffoperator> hacking on minix is like a high intensity, high reward activity

[15:18] <diffoperator> it will be painful but your maturity will develop rapidly

[15:18] <diffoperator> sanjoyd: turns out nanojit does not implement tracing, its just a really fast JIT with its own  IR

[15:19] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: oh, okay.

[15:19] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: I was just talking about something that would, sort of, allow us to compose assembly in a platform non-specific way.

[15:19] <diffoperator> tracemonkey uses something called jstracer to analyse code that is "hot" and selectively JITs that

[15:19] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: so I won't have to worry about what the hex code for mov is.

[15:19] <diffoperator> so we "could" use nanojit for that

[15:19] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: oh, okay.

[15:20] <diffoperator> lexer/parser->cfg->nanojit?

[15:20] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: but I still think we're thinking too far ahead. :P

[15:20] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: yes, probably.

[15:20] <diffoperator> aye, lexer/parser first

[15:20] <$$$> diffoperator: *lexer* first. :D

[15:20] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: I also want to implement some inline caching.

[15:20] <diffoperator> can we just take CPython and rip out its parsing/lexing infrastructure?

[15:21] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: if I don't get much done by this weekend, perhaps it would be intelligent to do so.

[15:21] <lupo33> diffoperator, sanjoyd: OK.

[15:21] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: it would be nice to have a faster and more streamlined parser in C++, I think.

[15:21] <diffoperator> ok, this weekend I will be travelling anyway

[15:22] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: in fact, that is exactly what unladen swallow did -- start from the place where CPython has already generated the bytecode.

[15:22] <diffoperator> right, i remember

[15:22] <diffoperator> unladen swallow is written in C++

[15:22] <$$$> ?

[15:22] <sanjoyd> In fact, do you think it'll be better the other war around?

[15:22] <sanjoyd> diffoperator: the LLVM parts are, I think.

[15:22] <diffoperator> what?

[15:22] <sanjoyd> LLVM has a C api too, so I can't be sure.

[15:22] <sanjoyd> s/war/way/

[15:23] <sanjoyd> i.e. first use the CPython frontend.

[15:23] <sanjoyd> (By wrapping it around some classes etc.)

[15:23] <sanjoyd> And start with the more fun parts.

[15:23] <sanjoyd> If we see the need later, we can re-write the frontend in C++.

[15:23] <diffoperator> hmm we could

[15:24] <sanjoyd> I think this makes more sense ... more importantly we won't be bored to death before we start seeing some results. :)

[15:24] <diffoperator> oh ok then

[15:24] <diffoperator> prepare a roadmap and let me know, i'll start experimenting with nanojit tomorrow

[16:25] <maxking> I tried upgrading from debian stable to testing but size mi-match error is coming everytime

[16:26] <maxking> I tried changing the proxy and mirror as well but no use.

[16:26] <maxking> Any help?

[16:33] <sanjoyd> maxking: use aria2c to download the files and then use apt-get to install them.

[16:33] <sanjoyd> maxking: wait ...

[16:34] <sanjoyd> maxking: ^

[16:35] <sanjoyd> Save this as fast-apt-get, chmod +x it, and then instead of sudo apt-get install foo, do fast-apt-get install foo.

[16:35] <maxking> sanjoyd: Thanx i'll try it then.

[16:38] <sa1> sanjoyd: I used to have the same problem when I was on Ubuntu. Changing the internet connection(as in using my USB modem) used to fix it. Is it a problem with our proxies? Do they cache corrupted files or something?

[16:38] <sanjoyd> sa1: yes, yes.

[16:39] <sanjoyd> sa1: rather, I think so, I think so.

[16:40] <sa1> pacman has been positively peaceful in this regard.  :) Also allows me to use any downloader as the backend.

[16:48] <maxking> sanjoyd:after saving it as fast-apt-get then?

[16:48] <maxking> chmod +x fast-apt-get?

[16:48] <sanjoyd> 22:09 <sanjoyd> Save this as fast-apt-get, chmod +x it, and then

[16:48] <sanjoyd>                 instead of sudo apt-get install foo, do

[16:48] <$$$>                 fast-apt-get install foo.

[16:48] <sanjoyd> :D

[16:51] <maxking> command not found

[16:51] <maxking> :O

[16:51] <sanjoyd> If you have it in the current dir, you need to do ./fast-apt-get

[16:51] <sanjoyd> Or you can put it somewhere on your path.

[16:51] <lupo33> sanjoyd: http://viewer.opencalais.com/

[16:52] <sanjoyd> lupo33: check PM!

[16:53] <maxking> Illegal option- for ./fast-apt-get

[16:53] <sanjoyd> maxking: works on my comp, try fixing it?

[20:01] <sa1> artagnon: congrats again.

[20:12] <artagnon> sa1: Results aren't out yet, so I wouldn't be celebrating yet :P

[20:12] <artagnon> Plus, there'll be 4 more interviews :)

[20:13] <artagnon> ... but yeah, thanks :)

[20:16] <sa1> 4 more interviews? as in, 4 more Google rounds or other places?

[20:18] <sanjoyd> artagnon: awesome!

[20:19] <artagnon> sa1: Google rounds.

[20:20] <artagnon> sanjoyd: 'twas a *cakewalk*.  I can't wait to take on more interviews.

[20:21] * artagnon dozes off
